## Seed measurements, April 6th–9th 2025

Raman spectrum measurements during the week before passover, performed on four groups: Control, rot of stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3.

Felipe layed 3 seeds on a petri plate and noted each seed with a roman numeral: i, ii, iii. We then captured the spectra of each seed *twice* – pointing the laser once at the center of the seed and a second time a bit to its side. For each experiment group this was done with 20 petri plates – i.e. 120 spectra measrurements for each group.
Each recording from the spectrometer was saved as a `csv` and `spe` file, with a running filename: `001.csv`, `002.csv`,etc.
The spectrometer's exposure times varied for each measurement, and they are listed in `correspondence_exposure_times.xlsx`.

*To do* : After measuring spectra on a seed, felipe layed the seed in an Assay microplate (באריות) and noted the seed's location in the microplate. He then photographed the microplate to check for the rot level of the seed.
We need to cross check after looking at the photos that indeed a seed of group x fits to that group.
